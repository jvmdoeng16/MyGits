YOU ARE DUMB!
THE ROLLBACK IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF YOU ADD THE FILE TO GIT BEFORE CHANGE IT!!!

It is possible to print the differences between two versions of a file using the command:
	1. git diff file_name.ext
If we mess up some of our files, git lets us roll back to a previous version this way
	2. git checkout file_name.ext
This file was modified in the other branch.
