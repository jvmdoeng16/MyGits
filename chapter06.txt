Removing files from staging area is possible via
	1. git rm --chached -r file_name.ext (or . to remove all files)
It is also possible to keep some files only in the local repository thanks to .gitignore
However, we cannot add ignored files to git. So, I think it is not possible to keep track of its versions.
