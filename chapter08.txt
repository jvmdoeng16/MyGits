Git gives us the possibility to duplicate the master branch and start a new work from the current master's version.
This is called branching
	1. git branch # shows the branches and the actived one
	2. git branch "branch_name" # creates a branch
	3. git checkout "branch_name" # changes the branch
If we want to join two different branches
	4. git merge "branch_name"
It is important to say that the "branch_name" files versions will override the current activated branch, i.e,
if we want to merge the other branch with the master branch, we need to activate the master, and, then use
the command merge.
